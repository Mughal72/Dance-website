// MongoDb Compass & Installing Mongoose

// MongoDB Compass analyzes your documents and displays rich structures within your collections through an intuitive GUI. It allows you to quickly visualize and explore your schema to understand the frequency, types and ranges of fields in your data set.

// It does not let you type the commands. Itâ€™s not the matter that we cannot type the commands but a person who is managing a database and wants to add certain data without any coding, he can use MongoDb compass.

// For connecting the MongoDb Compass with Mongo database, you need to click on New Collection > Fill in Connection Fields Individually > Connect.

/**Let us now see how to connect this MongoDb compass to Node.Js. We can do this with the help of Mongoose. It is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.
We will make a new folder as Mongoosetut. We will open the terminal window and install npm. After installing the package.json file we will write npm install mongoose to install the mongoose. */
